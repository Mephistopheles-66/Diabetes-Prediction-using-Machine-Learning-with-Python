# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-with-Python
A machine learning project that predicts whether a person has diabetes using the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. The data is preprocessed with StandardScaler and modeled using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Achieved around 78% accuracy and includes a simple system for making new predictions.
